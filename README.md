# Face Recognition and Detection System  

The Face Recognition and Detection System is a robust application developed using Google Colab, Python, and OpenCV. It captures images via the laptop’s camera and immediately displays the results within the Colab environment. Leveraging the MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) algorithm, the system provides efficient face detection and alignment with remarkable accuracy and precision.  

### **Features**  
- **Real-Time Image Capture**: Captures images directly through the laptop’s camera.  
- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images with high accuracy using the MTCNN algorithm.  
- **Facial Feature Recognition**: Identifies key facial features, showcasing a detailed understanding of face structure.  
- **Python & OpenCV Integration**: Combines the power of Python and OpenCV for seamless image processing.  
- **Colab Integration**: Displays processed images directly within the Colab notebook for convenience.  

### **Project Workflow**  
1. **Image Capture**: The system captures an image through the laptop’s camera.  
2. **Face Detection**: MTCNN detects faces and aligns them, ensuring precision.  
3. **Facial Feature Analysis**: Key facial points are identified and marked on the detected faces.  
4. **Visualization**: The results are displayed in the Colab notebook for immediate review.  

### **Prerequisites**  
Before running the project, ensure the following:  
- **Python 3.x installed.**  
- **Google Colab access for executing the project.** 
- **OpenCV and MTCNN libraries installed in your environment.**  

### **Results**  
The system excels in detecting faces and marking facial features, offering precise and reliable performance. Its integration with Colab makes it user-friendly and accessible, providing instant visualization of detection results.
